# CompScience2017

# This is my project for Computer Science

# I intend this project to be similar to Razer Cortex. My program will have 2 tabs, the first tab will show a list of games currently installed on the computer, and you will have the option to run the game from there. You can also add other programs such as Google Chrome for easy accessibility.

# On the second tab, you will have the option to disable Windows Shortcuts. An example of this would be the Windows Key and Alt+F4. By disabling these, you will no longer have any accidents in game.
